# Tableau-Sales-Dashboard

🔍 **Project Insights :**

-> Built a centralized dashboard featuring three core KPIs – Sales, Profit, and Quantity, allowing stakeholders to instantly evaluate overall business performance.

-> The Subcategory Comparison analysis helped identify which product lines were driving revenue and which were underperforming, supporting better product prioritization.

-> The Weekly Trends visualization revealed short-term sales fluctuations, enabling the business to track campaign impact and seasonal demand at a granular level.

-> Profit KPI analysis showed that high sales volume did not always translate to high profit, highlighting the need to review pricing and discount strategies.

-> Quantity KPI provided visibility into order volume patterns, helping operations teams plan inventory and logistics more effectively.

-> Interactive legends and filters allowed users to dynamically switch between subcategories and KPIs, promoting self-service analytics without technical support.

-> The dashboard layout followed best practices with:
    1. Clean KPI cards for executive view
    2. Comparative bar charts for category performance
    3. Trend lines for time-based monitoring
    
-> Overall, the solution reduced manual Excel reporting and enabled faster, data-driven decisions in sales planning, stock management, and profit optimization.
