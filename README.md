# Tableau-Sales-Dashboard

🔍 **Project Insights :**

1. Built a centralized dashboard featuring three core KPIs – Sales, Profit, and Quantity, allowing stakeholders to instantly evaluate overall business performance.

2. The Subcategory Comparison analysis helped identify which product lines were driving revenue and which were underperforming, supporting better product prioritization.

3. The Weekly Trends visualization revealed short-term sales fluctuations, enabling the business to track campaign impact and seasonal demand at a granular level.

4. Profit KPI analysis showed that high sales volume did not always translate to high profit, highlighting the need to review pricing and discount strategies.

5. Quantity KPI provided visibility into order volume patterns, helping operations teams plan inventory and logistics more effectively.

6. Interactive legends and filters allowed users to dynamically switch between subcategories and KPIs, promoting self-service analytics without technical support.

7. The dashboard layout followed best practices with:

a. Clean KPI cards for executive view
    
b. Comparative bar charts for category performance
    
c. Trend lines for time-based monitoring
    
8. Overall, the solution reduced manual Excel reporting and enabled faster, data-driven decisions in sales planning, stock management, and profit optimization.
